# Chapter_2
# Creating a Hello World App
In this chapter, I learned how to start a new Flutter project in Android Studio, which is a great way to kick off any Flutter app. Itâ€™s like building a house; you need a strong foundation. The instant reload feature is helpful because it shows you changes in your code right away, without needing to restart the app. This really saves time, especially when you are trying new ideas.Using themes is a smart way to make your app look appealing. I found out how to add styles to the whole app or just to certain sections. I also discovered that widgets are the main building blocks of Flutter apps. I learned about Stateless and Stateful widgets, which are key for handling data and user actions in your app. I also saw that using external packages can make things easier by adding features to your app without starting from scratch. I figured out how to search for and install these packages, which can save you a lot of time and work.
